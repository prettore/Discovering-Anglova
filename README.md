# Discovering Anglova - Vignette 2 Analysis

This repository contains a GitHub Pages website (https://prettore.github.io/Discovering-Anglova/) that showcases data analyses conducted to explore the characteristics of the Anglova Scenario Vignette 2. The analyses focus on spatiotemporal mobility metrics and communication patterns within the scenario.

## Overview

The Anglova Scenario was developed as part of the NATO IST-124 Research Task Group on Heterogeneous Networks: Improving Connectivity and Network Efficiency. It is an emulation scenario specifically developed for experimentation over emulated tactical networking environments.

Vignette 2 focuses on Troop Deployment and consists of detailed movement and pathloss parameters for a battalion-sized deployment.

This website provides interactive visualizations of:

- **Communication Analyses**: Patterns across different technologies (Bluetooth, UHF, VHF, Wi-Fi)
- **Spatiotemporal Analyses**: Mobility metrics including:
  - Acceleration
  - Delta Time
  - Destine Arrive Time
  - Distance (Total and Straight Line)
  - Path Tortuosity
  - Radius Gyration
  - Spatial Projection
  - Spatiotemporal Coverage
  - Speed
  - Time Stopped

## Website Structure

The website is organized into the following sections:

1. **Overview**: Introduction to the Anglova Scenario and the purpose of this analysis
